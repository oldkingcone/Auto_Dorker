# Auto_Dorker
Pure python based google auto dorker, it works dynamically(meaning that you can drop a new file holding the dorks into the directory and the program will pull it none the less)

## Install

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Up coming features.
I will be adding in a regex to detect and eliminate honeypots from entering the results.
