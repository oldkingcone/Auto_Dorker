# Auto_Dorker
Pure python based google auto dorker, it works dynamically(meaning that you can drop a new file holding the dorks into the directory and the program will add it to the into the rotation of files to be used, in the event you want to seperate the dorks between category.)

## Install

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Up coming features.
I will be adding in a regex to detect and eliminate honeypots from entering the results.
